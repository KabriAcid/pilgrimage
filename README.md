A private practice project implemented in Laravel project. The project is meant to manage pilgrimages and their accommodation in holy land. Accommodation is configured with the number and rooms as well as number of bed spaces per room. Normally, more than one room will have the same size which make the automatic configuration possible. Nonetheless, it is flexible enough to deal rooms with variation in number of bed spaces. The pilgrims can either be registered or uploaded as list prepared as spreadsheet document. The bed space allocation is also automatic but it flexible to accommodate allocation for pilgrims with special needs.
